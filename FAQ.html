			<h2>What do I do if a book is missing a cover image or other data?</h2><br>
			<h3>
				If a book is missing a cover image or a book page has inaccurate data, please post in the official Goodreads Librarians Group. Our army of volunteer librarians would be happy to help!

				Any member with librarian status can edit book data and generally correct any inaccuracies. If you have more than 50 books added and would like to become a librarian, please apply here.
